    "<p class=\"paragraph\">Epileptiform activity on EEG is indicative of cortical hyperexcitability, which carries an increased risk for seizures and the presence of an epileptic network within the brain. There are several types of epileptiform activity, including single discharges (sharps and spikes) and rhythmic and/or periodic activity. It is important to note that the presence of <strong>epileptiform activity is not sufficient for a diagnosis of epilepsy in a patient with no history of seizures</strong>. In a patient with a history of seizures, epileptiform activity in between seizures (interictal activity) is useful in helping to localize seizure onset.<br></p>"
